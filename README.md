# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Task  Description:

Improve StriveBooks
Start from your previous book store application, and apply the following improvements.
Make sure to refactor the grid of the BookList component in order to to have the book covers on the left, and the CommentArea component always visible on the right (create two columns). Remove CommentArea from the SingleBook component (we just need one).
Create the initial state for the CommentArea for when there's no data to be displayed (it shouldn't crash initially when no book is selected).
Now that the selected state property is stored in the BookList component, that piece of info should also be given to CommentArea as a prop; when selected changes (the user clicks on a new book) a new fetch should be performed and the comments on the right column of the page should update. You can achieve this using the componentDidUpdate() method, listening for any change in the selected prop.
When the comments section works again, double check if the AddComment component also still works. Depending on your implementation, that may also need a little refactor in order to keep up-to-date the elementId property (that needs to be part of the body of your POST request) with the asin of the latest book you clicked on.
