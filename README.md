# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Task  Description:;
Convert App into a class component, and add a state object to it with a query text property.
Create a MyNavbar component for the app, taking as a reference one from the react-bootstrap documentation. Add a text input field to it, with ‘Search here’ as a placeholder.
Insert the MyNavbar component into the children of App, passing props to it for accessing the query property from the state as well as a method capable of setting the state into App with a new query value. These props are going to be given to the input field into MyNavbar, making it a controlled element.
Now you should be able to change the query property, into the state of App, from MyNavbar. Pass the query value from the state of App to the BookList component as a prop, so it can access it to restore correctly its filtering logic.
The next feature will be allowing for one and only selected book at a time. Clicking a new book should de-select the previous one, and load the comments of the freshly selected book.

This will involve elevating the selected state property, previously part of SingleBook, to BookList, storing into it the asin of the currently selected book; for achieving this you can follow a procedure similar to the one you just completed.

 

EXTRA
use React.Context for sharing at application level a theme property: the value of theme can be light or dark, and it should affect some styling property of the major components (MyNavbar, BookList, SingleBook etc.).
Provide a way of toggling the theme value and check if the application responds correctly to the applied style.
